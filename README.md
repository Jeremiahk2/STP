# STP
This was a group project that I worked on in a team of two. It is an application that can be used to manage a user's System Test Plan, including saving it, editing it, and deleting it.
It was originally done in a group repository and was ported over to this github for your viewing convenience. The commit history was left intact so you can see what my contribution included.
To sum it up, I worked on all facets of the program except for the UI, including testing, debugging, documentation, and implementation of the core codebase of the project.
